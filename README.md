# **Football Analytics Project: Forming XI of the UCL 22/23**

## **Project Overview**
This project presents an in-depth analysis of soccer players' performances across different positions to form the "XI of the UCL 22/23". It leverages advanced statistical methods and data visualization techniques to evaluate and select the top performers. The analysis is segmented into five Python scripts, each serving a distinct purpose towards the final selection of players.

## **Scripts Description**
1. Best XI Analysis (UCL_22_23_Best_XI_Analysis.ipynb)
Purpose: Integrates all positional analyses to form the best possible team lineup based on recent tournament data.
Visualizations: Includes a Violin Plot to compare players' scores across positions.
2. Goalkeeper Analysis (goalkeeper_analysis.py)
3. Defender Analysis (defender_analysis.py)
4. Midfielder Analysis (midfielder_analysis.py)
5. Forward Analysis (forward_analysis.py)
Purpose (for all above): Analyzes players in the specified position using key performance metrics.
Visualizations: Features Heatmap, Barplot, and Radar Chart to showcase various aspects of player performance.
Technologies
Data Manipulation: Pandas
Visualization: Seaborn, Bokeh, Matplotlib
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for scaling and normalization


## **Forming XI of the Tournament Analysis**
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis aimed at forming the Best XI of the Tournament, leveraging advanced statistical analysis and visualization techniques across multiple Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks. The project utilizes a variety of Python libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Bokeh for interactive plotting, to analyze player performance and derive the top players in each position.

## **Project Structure**
1. Best XI Analysis (UCL_22_23_Best_XI_Analysis.ipynb)
Purpose: Integrates all positional analyses to form the best possible team lineup based on recent tournament data.
Visualizations: Includes a Violin Plot to compare players' scores across positions.
2. Goalkeeper Analysis (goalkeeper_analysis.py)
